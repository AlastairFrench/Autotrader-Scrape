# Autotrader-Scrape
Python script to scrape Autotrader listings to investigate effect of year and mileage on car price and use a linear regression model to predict the price of a car.

Unfortunately AUtotrader now appears to not allow scraping of their website.

I have also included a couple of the graphs that I created during my initial analysis.
